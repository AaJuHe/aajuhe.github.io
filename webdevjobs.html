                    <p class="lead" style="padding-top: 20px;">The first thing I did was input “Fresno Web Development Jobs” in Google. While the first few sites were from Indeed, I decided to scroll down a bit and perused some of job listings on ZipRecruiter. One that stood out among the others was a developer job for a company called SharePoint via Robert Half from a site called Beyond. This one may not be optimal for many because it is only for one year; furthermore, it requires some familiarity with SharePoint projects in order to be effective. It is still an interesting job posting nonetheless:</p>

                    <p class="lead">Another job I found was something called a UX Designer for Booking.com via SimplyHired. It requires relocation to Amsterdam and it is primarily a front-end development position. It appears to allow some freedom in terms of what tools a developer uses in order to get the job done. A more detailed description resides below:</p>

                    <p class="lead">UX Designer (HTML/CSS)</p>

                    <p class="lead">Technology - Amsterdam, Netherlands</p>

                    <p class="lead">Booking.com BV (the company behind Booking.com™, the market leading online accommodation reservation service in the world) is looking for the world’s smartest designers. As a member of our Front End team you’ll be given the freedom to make meaningful and measurable improvements impacting millions of people. You’ll join us at our beautiful Amsterdam HQ and work with some of our industry’s smartest people.</p>

                    <p class="lead">B.responsible</p>

                    <p class="lead">Our guiding principle is that by helping our users we help our business. As a designer in our Front End team you’ll be a key part of the idea generation process, working in a small startup-like group which takes full ownership of their part of our platform. You’ll work with developers, product owners, copywriters and user researchers to conceive, analyse, hand code &amp; test your ideas.</p>

                    <p class="lead">B.creative</p>

                    <p class="lead">‘Designer’ is just what it says on your CV – you’d be just as happy to be labeled an Engineer, or Analyst; a Builder, Hacker or Maker. Because what you really do, what you live for, is solving problems. Your portfolio isn’t a series of beautiful but generic templates – it’s a collection of stories that you can discuss with enthusiasm, and regret … because you’re always getting better at what you do and you’re never satisfied with ‘good enough.’. You’re equally comfortable discussing colour theory, user psychology, or the semantic implications of the DIV tag, you’re a writer of excellent HTML &amp; CSS. You’re excited about the endless potential of the web, and being able to build things that millions of people can use every day.</p>

                    <p class="lead">B.skilled</p>

                    <p class="lead">Your core responsibility will be in combining your knowledge and expertise with the goals of our business to deliver a world-class user experience to our diverse, loyal user-base. You’ll be comfortable taking a data-led approach to design. You will be a passionate advocate for the user, dedicated to the craft of design and excited about working in an agile, collaborative environment.</p>

                    <p class="lead">Experience: You have at least two years of relevant experience</p>
                    
                    <p class="lead">Simplicity: Good design is invisible.
                    Collaboration: You’ll be working alongside developers and copywriters to create elegant user experiences; you should thrive on feedback, critique and iteration.
                    Visual Design: Photoshop, Fireworks, Keynote, MS Paint – whatever works for you. Your process is your own; you get to decide which tools you use.</p>
                    
                    <p class="lead">HTML/CSS: You’ll be given full ownership of your ideas, and so you’ll be required to both create beautiful mockups/wireframes/prototypes – and implement them.
                    Data: You are a successful Designer, but you like to measure your success with data and learn from it every day
                    E-Commerce: You understand the challenges and the opportunities that a large e-commerce website has to offer
                    You’re excited to learn how to work with our templating and version control systems.</p>

                    <p class="lead">B.offered</p>

                    <p class="lead">We are a performance-based company that offers career advancement and lucrative compensation, including bonuses and stock potential.  We also offer what we call the “Booking Deal” with other competitive perks and benefits.  IT also has monthly hackathons, training and attends/speaks at global conferences.</p>

                    <p class="lead">This position is open to worldwide candidates and in the case of relocation, we will assist you with a generous relocation package, ensuring a smooth transition to working and living in Amsterdam.  We have successfully relocated 200+ IT professionals to Amsterdam in the last year!</p>

                    <p class="lead">In addition to looking up jobs, I perused the Bureau of Labor Statistics for more information about web developer jobs. It appears from 2014-2024, it is expected that web developer jobs are to grow approximately twenty-seven percent, which is much faster than average. It makes sense because more businesses are embracing e-commerce and providing services online; therefore, a well-designed website or web application is necessary. Another statistic that stood out to me was the median pay. In 2015, the median pay was $64,970 per year, or roughly $31.23 per hour. I can imagine that growing within the next few years with the rising population of the Internet.</p>
